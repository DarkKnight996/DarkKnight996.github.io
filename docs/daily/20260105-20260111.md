This method facilitates the detection of block withholding attacks in mining pools without trusted hardware, thereby supporting the design of verifiable, decentralized pools. The construction maintains core PoW properties while adding an auditability layer, which can be deployed either via consensus changes or as a pool-level mechanism.

  - **authors:** Daniel Qian, Xiyu Hao, Jinkun Geng, Yuncheng Yao, Aurojit Panda, Jinyang Li, Anirudh Sivaraman
  - **institution:** New York University, Stony Brook University, New York University Shanghai
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03390
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents Aspen, a leaderless Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol that uses a best-effort sequencing layer with synchronized clocks and network delay estimates to achieve low-latency consensus (2Δ+ε) even under contention. It requires extra replicas (n=3f+2p+1) to tolerate network delays and falls back to a PBFT-style protocol when optimistic conditions fail. Experiments show Aspen commits requests in under 75 ms, offering a 1.2–3.3× speedup over prior protocols while handling 19,000 requests per second.

  - **authors:** Ping Luo, Jiahuan Wang, Ziqing Wen, Tao Sun, Dongsheng Li
  - **institution:** National University of Defense Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03584
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a client-side method called Exploratory–Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR) to stabilize federated learning by regulating local gradient dynamics under heterogeneous data distributions. It concludes that this regulation of local gradients effectively suppresses destabilizing drift and consistently improves the stability and convergence of federated learning across various state-of-the-art methods.

It establishes that PoCmt enforces a linear Sybil cost, unlike Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, and achieves safety, liveness, and fairness under partial synchrony.
