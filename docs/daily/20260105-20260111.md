  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02949
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper explores frameworks and solutions for blockchain interoperability, discussing platforms that enable heterogeneous blockchains to connect and share information. It concludes that as applications become more complex, interoperable solutions are a necessity, but several challenges remain to be solved in this domain.

- **[arXiv260107] Optimal Oblivious Load-Balancing for Sparse Traffic in Large-Scale Satellite Networks**
  - **tags:** [sys], [network routing], [oblivious load-balancing, torus network, linear programming, Valiant Load Balancing, worst-case load]
  - **authors:** Rudrapatna Vallabh Ramakanth, Eytan Modiano
  - **institution:** Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02537
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper formulates the problem of oblivious load-balancing for sparse traffic in a torus network as a linear program and constructs an optimal routing scheme. It shows that the Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal for sparse traffic and establishes a lower bound for any oblivious scheme, along with a performance gap compared to non-oblivious routing.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a new software-defined networking (SDN)-inspired framework for serving multi-agent LLM pipelines. It aims to make agent communication programmable and adaptive to runtime system state, enabling more efficient and responsive serving. The authors conclude that this architecture addresses the limitations of static serving strategies and paves the way for intent-driven agentic systems.

- **[arXiv260107] First Provably Optimal Asynchronous SGD for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Data**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [asynchronous SGD, staleness, heterogeneous workers, federated learning, gradient table, task allocation]
  - **authors:** Artavazd Maranjyan
  - **institution:** King Abdullah University of Science and Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02523
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This dissertation introduces new asynchronous SGD algorithms, Ringmaster ASGD and Ringleader ASGD, which use techniques like selective update discarding and structured gradient tables to handle staleness and heterogeneous data. It demonstrates that these methods can achieve optimal time complexity, matching synchronous guarantees, and proposes ATA for adaptive task allocation to improve resource efficiency. The work establishes asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and efficient foundation for distributed learning.

- **[arXiv260107] APoW: Auditable Proof-of-Work Against Block Withholding Attacks**
  - **tags:** [sys], [blockchain security], [proof-of-work, nonce space auditing, block withholding attack detection, hashcash, decentralized mining pools]
  - **authors:** Sergio Demian Lerner
  - **institution:** Fairgate Labs, Rootstock Labs
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02496
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces APoW, an auditable proof-of-work scheme that enables miners to probabilistically attest to having searched specific nonce space regions, allowing retroactive auditing of claimed work. This method facilitates the detection of block withholding attacks in mining pools without trusted hardware, thereby supporting the design of verifiable, decentralized pools. The construction maintains core PoW properties while adding an auditability layer, which can be deployed either via consensus changes or as a pool-level mechanism.

- **[arXiv260107] Chronicals: A High-Performance Framework for LLM Fine-Tuning with 3.51x Speedup over Unsloth**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm training], [fused triton kernels, cut cross-entropy, lora+, sequence packing, flashattention, online softmax]
  - **authors:** Arjun S. Nair
  - **institution:** Independent Researcher
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02609
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** Chronicals is a high-performance framework for LLM fine-tuning that integrates four key optimizations: fused Triton kernels, a memory-efficient Cut Cross-Entropy loss, LoRA+ with differential learning rates, and sequence packing. It achieves a 3.51x speedup over the Unsloth framework for full fine-tuning by dramatically reducing memory footprint and computational waste. The paper also critically notes that a competing benchmark showed zero gradient norms, indicating the model was not actually training.
