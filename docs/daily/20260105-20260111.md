  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00397
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents Revati, a GPU-free time-warp emulator for LLM serving that directly executes real serving system code by intercepting CUDA calls and performing virtual time jumps instead of running actual GPU kernels. It introduces a coordination protocol to synchronize these time jumps across distributed processes. The system achieves less than 5% prediction error and runs 5-17x faster than real GPU execution on frameworks like vLLM and SGLang.
