- **[arXiv260302] nvidia-pcm: A D-Bus-Driven Platform Configuration Manager for OpenBMC Environments**
  - **tags:** [sys], [firmware management], [D-Bus, JSON configuration, environment variables, systemd, OpenBMC]
  - **authors:** Harinder Singh
  - **institution:** NVIDIA Corporation
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24237

At boot, it queries hardware identity via D-Bus and exports platform-specific configurations as environment variables, enabling a single firmware image to serve multiple server platforms. This approach eliminates the need for separate firmware builds per variant, significantly reducing maintenance overhead.

- **[arXiv260302] Green or Fast? Learning to Balance Cold Starts and Idle Carbon in Serverless Computing**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [deep reinforcement learning, serverless computing, cold-start optimization, carbon-aware management, sequential decision problem]

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23464
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents 2G2T, a protocol for verifiably outsourcing multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) computations to an untrusted server. It uses a one-time setup to generate a public merged-bases vector, allowing verification with only a single inner product and constant group operations, while the server performs two MSMs. The method achieves statistical soundness with a constant-size server response, making verification up to ~300x faster than local computation for large inputs.

- **[arXiv260302] FedDAG: Clustered Federated Learning via Global Data and Gradient Integration for Heterogeneous Environments**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [clustered federated learning, dual-encoder architecture, weighted class-wise similarity, gradient integration, cross-cluster feature transfer]
  - **authors:** Anik Pramanik, Murat Kantarcioglu, Vincent Oria, Shantanu Sharma
  - **institution:** New Jersey Institute of Technology, Virginia Tech
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23504
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** FedDAG is a clustered federated learning framework that uses a weighted, class-wise similarity metric combining both data and gradient information for client clustering, and employs a dual-encoder architecture to enable cross-cluster knowledge transfer. This approach provides a more holistic client similarity assessment and allows cluster models to benefit from diverse data across clusters. Experiments show that FedDAG consistently outperforms existing clustered FL methods in accuracy under heterogeneous data settings.

  - **institution:** Iowa State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, Amazon GenAI
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23556
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Rudder, a software module that uses LLM agents for adaptive prefetching in distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) training to minimize communication stalls. It leverages the in-context learning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to dynamically decide what and when to prefetch, outperforming static methods. Evaluations show up to 91% improvement in training performance over a baseline with no prefetching and an 82% improvement over static prefetching.
