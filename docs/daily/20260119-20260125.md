- **[arXiv260119] Konflux: Optimized Function Fusion for Serverless Applications**
  - **tags:** [sys], [serverless computing], [function fusion, FaaS, cost optimization, latency optimization, emulation]
  - **authors:** Niklas Kowallik, Trever Schirmer, David Bermbach
  - **institution:** TU Berlin
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11156
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents Konflux, a system that analyzes all possible function fusion configurations for serverless applications by emulating the FaaS platform locally. This approach eliminates the need for costly production benchmarking. The main conclusion is that only a limited set of fusion configurations are optimal, and these are heavily dependent on the specific cloud pricing model.

- **[arXiv260119] AFLL: Real-time Load Stabilization for MMO Game Servers Based on Circular Causality Learning**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [backpropagation, gradient descent, adaptive feedback loop, real-time learning, load stabilization, message throttling]
  - **authors:** Shinsuk Kang, Youngjae Kim
  - **institution:** Sogang University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10998
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes AFLL, an adaptive feedback loop learning system that uses backpropagation to learn the causal relationship between server messages and client load in real-time, enabling predictive message throttling. It significantly reduces CPU usage, thread contention, and performance spikes in MMO game servers while maintaining zero learning overhead. The results demonstrate that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.

- **[arXiv260119] A Survey of Real-Time Support, Analysis, and Advancements in ROS 2**
  - **tags:** [sys], [real-time systems], [ROS 2, DDS, executors, timing analysis, publish-subscribe, micro-ROS]
  - **authors:** Daniel Casini, Jian-Jia Chen, Jing Li, Federico Reghenzani, Harun Teper
  - **institution:** Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, TU Dortmund University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Politecnico di Milano
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10722
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of research efforts to analyze and enhance the real-time capabilities of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). It reviews key contributions on scheduling mechanisms, timing analysis for executors, communication delays, and community-driven runtime enhancements. The survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in understanding and improving the timing predictability of ROS 2 for real-time robotic applications.

- **[arXiv260119] Space-Optimal, Computation-Optimal, Topology-Agnostic, Throughput-Scalable Causal Delivery through Hybrid Buffering**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed systems], [causal delivery, SPS+FIFO, hybrid buffering, sender-buffering, receiver-buffering, topology-agnostic]
  - **authors:** Paulo Sérgio Almeida
  - **institution:** INESC TEC, University of Minho
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11487
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces a novel hybrid buffering algorithm for causal message delivery, combining sender-buffering to enforce Sender Permission to Send (SPS) and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO order. This approach achieves effectively constant metadata size per message and amortized constant processing overhead, overcoming the limitations of prior sender-only or receiver-only buffering methods. It is presented as a topology-agnostic, throughput-scalable solution with space and computational optimality.
