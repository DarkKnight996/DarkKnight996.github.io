  - **tags:** [sys], [HPC job scheduling], [malleable jobs, resource elasticity, ElastiSim, job scheduling strategies, workload simulation]
  - **authors:** Patrick Zojer, Jonas Posner, Taylan Özden
  - **institution:** University of Kassel, Technical University of Darmstadt
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17318
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper evaluates the benefits of malleable job scheduling in HPC clusters by simulating varying proportions of malleable jobs using real-world supercomputer workload traces and the ElastiSim software. It finds that malleable scheduling significantly improves key metrics like job turnaround time and node utilization, with substantial gains even at low adoption rates, demonstrating its potential to address inefficiencies in current HPC practices.

- **[arXiv260220] Do GPUs Really Need New Tabular File Formats?**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [GPU kernels], [Parquet, columnar storage, GPU scan, file configuration, row group, page encoding, compression, bandwidth optimization]
  - **authors:** Jigao Luo, Qi Chen, Carsten Binnig
  - **institution:** TU Darmstadt, hessian.AI, DFKI
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17335
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper systematically studies how Parquet file configurations, such as row group size and page encoding, affect GPU scan performance. It concludes that Parquet's poor GPU performance is not inherent to the format but results from CPU-centric defaults, and by applying GPU-aware configurations, read bandwidth can be dramatically increased without needing a new file format.

- **[arXiv260220] Read-Modify-Writable Snapshots from Read/Write operations**
  - **tags:** [sys], [concurrent algorithms], [linearizability, wait-freedom, lock-freedom, read/write operations, RMWable snapshots]
  - **authors:** Armando Castañeda, Braulio Ramses Hernández Martínez
  - **institution:** Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16903
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms for asynchronous concurrent shared-memory systems. The first algorithm works in the standard model with a finite, known number of processes, while the second operates in a model with unbounded concurrency. The main conclusion is that RMWable snapshots are possible using only simple read/write operations, without relying on more powerful primitives like compare&swap.

- **[arXiv260220] Heterogeneous Federated Fine-Tuning with Parallel One-Rank Adaptation**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm training], [federated learning, low-rank adaptation, heterogeneous clients, parallel one-rank adaptation, select-n-fold, federated fine-tuning]
  - **authors:** Zikai Zhang, Rui Hu, Jiahao Xu
  - **institution:** University of Nevada, Reno
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16936
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes Fed-PLoRA, a federated fine-tuning framework that introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA) and a Select-N-Fold strategy to handle heterogeneous client resources by allowing different LoRA ranks. This approach reduces initialization and aggregation noise compared to standard methods. Experiments show that Fed-PLoRA outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency for LLM fine-tuning tasks.

- **[arXiv260220] Informative Trains: A Memory-Efficient Journey to a Self-Stabilizing Leader Election Algorithm in Anonymous Graphs**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed algorithms], [self-stabilization, leader election, anonymous networks, information train, probabilistic algorithm, state model, synchronous scheduler]
  - **authors:** Lelia Blin, Sylvain Gay, Isabella Ziccardi
  - **institution:** Université Paris Cité, CNRS, IRIF, École Normale Supérieure
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17541
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses only O(log log n) bits of memory per node. It introduces an "information train" mechanism to propagate information efficiently while maintaining low local memory. The algorithm converges almost surely to a unique leader and stabilizes within polynomial rounds, achieving space-optimal memory complexity for general graphs.

- **[arXiv260220] Visual Insights into Agentic Optimization of Pervasive Stream Processing Services**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [autoscaling, service level objectives (SLOs), multi-dimensional elasticity, regression analysis, edge computing, stream processing]
  - **authors:** Boris Sedlak, Víctor Casamayor Pujol, Schahram Dustdar
  - **institution:** Universitat Pompeu Fabra, TU Wien
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17282
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents a platform (MUDAP) and an agent (RASK) for context-aware, multi-dimensional autoscaling of stream processing services at the edge. The agent uses regression analysis to understand the impact of different service parameters on performance and dynamically optimizes service execution to meet fluctuating demands and resource constraints. This approach enables services to autonomously adjust their operation to sustain critical Service Level Objectives like latency in pervasive applications.

- **[arXiv260220] Trivance: Latency-Optimal AllReduce by Shortcutting Multiport Networks**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [cluster infrastructure], [AllReduce, torus networks, latency-optimal, congestion reduction, bidirectional ring, Bruck's algorithm, Swing, collective communication]
  - **authors:** Anton Juerss, Vamsi Addanki, Stefan Schmid
  - **institution:** Weizenbaum Institute, TU Berlin, Purdue University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17254
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Trivance, a novel AllReduce algorithm that achieves latency-optimal performance in log3 n steps on bidirectional ring and torus networks while reducing congestion compared to prior methods. It exploits both transmission ports per step to triple communication distance and uses joint reductions to improve steps and congestion. Empirical evaluation shows Trivance outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% across various message sizes and network topologies.

- **[arXiv260220] TopoSZp: Lightweight Topology-Aware Error-controlled Compression for Scientific Data**
  - **tags:** [sys], [scientific data compression], [error-bounded lossy compression, topology preservation, critical point detection, SZp compressor, local ordering preservation, saddle-point refinement]

  - **institution:** University of Utah, Argonne National Laboratory, University of Kentucky, University of Virginia, The Ohio State University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17552
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware lossy compressor built on SZp that integrates critical point detection and local ordering preservation within a strict error bound. It demonstrates that TopoSZp significantly better preserves topological features like minima and saddle points compared to standard compressors, while offering orders-of-magnitude faster compression and decompression than prior topology-aware methods.

- **[arXiv260220] Privacy-Aware Split Inference with Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models over Wide-Area Networks**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [split inference, speculative decoding, lookahead decoding, privacy-aware inference, wide-area networks, inversion attack, n-gram speculation, greedy argmax]
  - **authors:** Michael Cunningham
  - **institution:** Not explicitly provided; author name only (Michael Cunningham). Unable to infer institution from given content.
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16760
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper presents a privacy-aware LLM inference system that splits a transformer model between a local trusted device and an untrusted cloud GPU, using speculative (lookahead) decoding to mitigate the latency of wide-area networks. The system ensures raw tokens never leave the local device and demonstrates a tunable privacy-performance tradeoff, achieving practical throughput (e.g., 8.7-9.3 tok/s for Mistral 7B) over an ~80ms WAN link while maintaining output identical to standard greedy decoding.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17610
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper evaluates the performance of DAOS and Ceph object storage systems for large-scale Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and HPC applications by developing new software adapters and conducting extensive I/O benchmarks against Lustre file systems. The study finds that both object stores perform well, but DAOS demonstrates superior scalability and flexibility for large-scale I/O workloads, suggesting promising potential for broader adoption in HPC centers.

- **[arXiv260220] Catastrophic Forgetting Resilient One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [diffusion training], [one-shot federated learning, incremental learning, catastrophic forgetting, vision-language model, diffusion model, selective sample retention]
  - **authors:** Obaidullah Zaland, Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan, Monowar Bhuyan
  - **institution:** Umeå University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17625
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes OSI-FL, a one-shot incremental federated learning framework that uses a vision-language model to generate client embeddings and a diffusion model to synthesize training data at the server, augmented with a selective sample retention strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The method addresses communication overhead and forgetting in incremental data scenarios. Experiments show it outperforms traditional and one-shot FL baselines on class- and domain-incremental tasks across multiple datasets.

- **[arXiv260220] Guarding the Middle: Protecting Intermediate Representations in Federated Split Learning**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [federated split learning, differential privacy, microaggregation, data reconstruction attack, k-anonymity]
  - **authors:** Obaidullah Zaland, Sajib Mistry, Monowar Bhuyan
  - **institution:** Umeå University, Curtin University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.17614
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes KD-UFSL, a method that combines k-anonymity via microaggregation and differential privacy to protect intermediate data (smashed data) in U-shaped federated split learning from reconstruction attacks. The experiments show that KD-UFSL significantly increases reconstruction error and reduces similarity between original and reconstructed data while preserving the utility of the global model. The method is suitable for balancing privacy and utility in large-scale, privacy-sensitive applications.
