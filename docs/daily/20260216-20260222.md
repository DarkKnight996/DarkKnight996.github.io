  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper provides a complete complexity classification for local optimization problems in directed cycles within the distributed LOCAL model. It shows that for any constant approximation ratio, the problem falls into one of four deterministic and randomized complexity classes. The authors also present an efficient meta-algorithm to determine the class and synthesize an optimal distributed algorithm.

- **[arXiv260216] DRAMatic Speedup: Accelerating HE Operations on a Processing-in-Memory System**
  - **tags:** [sys], [hardware acceleration], [residue number system, number-theoretic transform, processing-in-memory]

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12305
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** OptiML is an end-to-end framework that uses a two-stage process to generate and optimize CUDA kernels. It first synthesizes code from natural language using a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator, then refines it via Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by hardware-aware rewards from profiler feedback. The framework consistently produces verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines.

- **[arXiv260216] Distance-based certification for leader election in meshed graphs and local recognition of their subclasses**
  - **tags:** [sys], [graph theory], [proof labeling scheme, leader election, meshed graphs, distance verification, local certification]
  - **authors:** Jérémie Chalopin, Victor Chepoi, Maria Kokkou
  - **institution:** Aix-Marseille Université, Université Côte d'Azur, University of Crete
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12894
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents a 2-local proof labeling scheme using constant-size labels \{0,1,2\} to solve leader election in anonymous meshed graphs by verifying distances modulo 3 to a designated root. It also provides 3-local schemes to recognize subclasses of meshed graphs using labels of size O(log D). The main conclusion is that leader election can be certified locally with small labels in this broad class of graphs, and their subclasses can be locally recognized by leveraging distance verification and existing characterizations.
