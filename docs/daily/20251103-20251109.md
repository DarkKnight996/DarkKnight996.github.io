  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper investigates Byzantine attacks in RIS-enhanced cooperative spectrum sensing systems from a decision fusion perspective. The authors develop channel-aware attack strategies and show that optimal Byzantine attacks don't require global instantaneous channel state information and effectiveness primarily depends on the fraction of compromised nodes rather than channel dynamics. Their counterintuitive findings demonstrate that heavy reliance on global ICSI and decision fusion rules can be successfully relaxed for practical implementation.
