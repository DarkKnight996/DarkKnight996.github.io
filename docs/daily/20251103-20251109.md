  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [over-the-air federated learning, stochastic gradient descent, successive convex approximation, power-control design, bias-variance trade-off]
  - **authors:** Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicolò Michelusi
  - **institution:** Arizona State University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26722
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a novel over-the-air federated learning approach that allows structured model bias to reduce update variance under heterogeneous wireless conditions. The method uses a successive convex approximation algorithm for joint power-control optimization requiring only statistical channel state information. Experiments show this approach accelerates convergence and improves generalization compared to prior OTA-FL baselines by optimizing the bias-variance trade-off.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes ARC-Top-K, an All-Reduce compatible gradient compressor that aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using gradient sketches to enable efficient communication. This method preserves globally significant gradient information while being provably contractive and compatible with momentum error feedback. Empirical results show it matches Top-K accuracy while reducing training time by up to 60.7%, combining Rand-K's robustness with Top-K's performance.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper analyzes the environmental impact of GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines using the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework on a dataset of over 2.2 million workflow runs. The study reveals substantial carbon and water footprints, estimating 456.9 MTCO2e and 5,738.2 kiloliters respectively in the most likely scenario. The authors recommend mitigation strategies including deploying runners in environmentally favorable regions and reducing wasted computational resources.
