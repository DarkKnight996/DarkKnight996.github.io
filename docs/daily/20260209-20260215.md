- **[arXiv260209] Degradation of Feature Space in Continual Learning**
  - **tags:** [ai], [continual learning], [isotropic regularization, contrastive learning, rehearsal strategies, catastrophic forgetting, feature space geometry]
  - **authors:** Chiara Lanza, Roberto Pereira, Marco Miozzo, Eduard Angelats, Paolo Dini
