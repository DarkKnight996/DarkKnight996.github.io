- **[arXiv251225] Stochastic well-structured transition systems**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed systems theory], [well-structured transition systems, stochastic scheduling, population protocols, chemical reaction networks, gossip models, phase clock, BPP, BPL]
  - **authors:** James Aspnes
  - **institution:** Yale University

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper defines a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems (SWSTSs) by extending classical well-structured transition systems with a probabilistic scheduling rule. It shows that in these systems, any phase clock implementation fails after polynomially many expected steps, and any terminating computation finishes in expected polynomial time. This leads to a characterization of computational power, showing that augmented systems compute exactly the languages in BPP, while unaugmented ones compute symmetric languages in BPL.

The approach abstracts away from low-level implementation details to capture the logical essence of protocols like voting, broadcast, and agreement. The authors demonstrate that this method scales well and has been used to find errors in an industrial protocol, providing a foundation for verification and design improvements.
