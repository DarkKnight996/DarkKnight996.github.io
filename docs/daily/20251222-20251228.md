- **[arXiv251222] Fixed-Priority and EDF Schedules for ROS2 Graphs on Uniprocessor**
  - **tags:** [sys], [real-time systems], [fixed-priority scheduling, EDF, DAG task models, events executor, LIFO queue]
  - **authors:** Oren Bell, Harun Teper, Mario Günzel, Chris Gill, Jian-Jia Chen
  - **institution:** Washington University in St Louis, TU Dortmund University

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a novel scheduling approach for ROS2 applications by using an events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks on uniprocessor systems. The method abstracts ROS2 applications as forests of trees and maps them to traditional real-time DAG models, requiring a special LIFO-ordered events queue. The authors conclude that their implementation generates schedules equivalent to a conventional fixed-priority DAG scheduler, helping to bridge the gap between real-time systems theory and ROS2 scheduling.

The main finding is that the strength of the turbulent magnetic field from the small-scale dynamo reaches an asymptotic limit at a modest magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, which is far below physical interstellar values. This asymptotic behavior allows the model's characteristics to be incorporated into larger-scale galactic simulations.
