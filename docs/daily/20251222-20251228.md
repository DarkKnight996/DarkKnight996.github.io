  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [decentralized federated learning, evidential deep learning, Dirichlet-based evidential models, trust-aware aggregation, peer compatibility scoring, model personalization]
  - **authors:** Murtaza Rangwala, Richard O. Sinnott, Rajkumar Buyya
  - **institution:** The University of Melbourne
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19131
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents Murmura, a framework for decentralized federated learning that uses evidential deep learning to measure epistemic uncertainty and compute peer compatibility scores for trust-aware model aggregation. This enables nodes to personalize their models by selectively collaborating with compatible peers while excluding those with mismatched data distributions. The method significantly reduces performance degradation in non-IID settings and achieves faster convergence compared to baselines.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [length-aware scheduling, dynamic programming, runtime range refinement, decentralized load balancing, multi-instance serving, continuous batching]
  - **authors:** Yitao Yuan, Chenqi Zhao, Bohan Zhao, Zane Cao, Yongchao He, Wenfei Wu
  - **institution:** Peking University, ScitiX AI
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19179
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents L4, a runtime system for LLM serving that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances to reduce length heterogeneity within batches. It partitions instances into length-specialized groups forming a pipeline and uses a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal partitioning. The evaluation shows L4 significantly reduces latency and improves throughput compared to state-of-the-art multi-instance schedulers.

- **[arXiv251223] Faster Distributed Inference-Only Recommender Systems via Bounded Lag Synchronous Collectives**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [bounded lag synchronous, alltoallv, distributed inference, embedding tables, PyTorch Distributed]
  - **authors:** Kiril Dichev, Filip Pawlowski, Albert-Jan Yzelman
  - **institution:** Huawei Technologies Switzerland AG
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19342
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes a bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv collective operation to reduce synchronization overhead in distributed deep learning recommender model inference. This method allows slower processes to lag behind within a bounded number of iterations, preserving accuracy while improving performance. The authors demonstrate that BLS significantly improves latency and throughput for unbalanced inference runs, effectively masking process delays.

- **[arXiv251223] Simulations between Strongly Sublinear MPC and Node-Capacitated Clique**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed computing], [MPC, Node-Capacitated Clique, simulation, round-preserving, strongly sublinear regime]
  - **authors:** Philipp Schneider, Julian Werthmann
  - **institution:** CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Paderborn University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19326
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper studies round-preserving simulations between the strongly sublinear Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model and the Node-Capacitated Clique (NCC) model under matched total resources. It provides techniques for efficient, constant-overhead simulations between the models and also proves impossibility results that show the limitations of such simulations are inherent.

  - **institution:** University of California, Los Angeles
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19606
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** RAPID-LLM is a performance modeling framework that combines a DeepFlow-based frontend to generate hardware-aware execution traces from an abstract LLM specification with an extended Astra-Sim backend to simulate these traces on explicit network topologies. It accurately predicts LLM training and inference performance on GPU clusters and enables exploration of hybrid parallelism, network faults, and hardware design variants.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The SPACE Centre of Excellence aims to re-engineer key astrophysical simulation codes to tackle the architectural complexity of exascale systems by adopting innovative programming paradigms and software solutions. It concludes that this collaborative effort, which also addresses high-performance data analysis using machine learning, is essential for enabling and promoting the use of exascale and post-exascale computing capabilities in Astrophysics and Cosmology.
