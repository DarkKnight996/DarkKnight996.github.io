- **[arXiv260224] The Category Mistake of Cislunar Time: Why NASA Cannot Synchronize What Doesn't Exist**
  - **tags:** [sys], [time synchronization, distributed systems], [Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC), atomic clocks, relativistic corrections, LunaNet, category mistake, ontic vs epistemic, Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO), Leibnizian operationalism, Wood-Spekkens fine-tuning argument]
  - **authors:** Paul Borrill
  - **institution:** DÆDÆLUS
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18641
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper argues that NASA's Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) program is based on a philosophical category mistake, treating synchronized time as an independent ontic entity rather than an epistemic, model-dependent construct. It analyzes the program using concepts from quantum foundations, such as the ontic-epistemic distinction and Spekkens' operationalism, to conclude that the project is conceptually incoherent. The author proposes a transactional alternative based on bilateral atomic interactions instead of unidirectional time distribution.

- **[arXiv260226] Lamport's Arrow of Time: The Category Mistake in Logical Clocks**
  - **tags:** [sys], [distributed systems theory], [logical clocks, happens-before relation, directed acyclic graph (DAG), mutual information conservation, indefinite causal order, CAP theorem, Fischer-Lynch-Paterson]
  - **authors:** Paul Borrill
  - **institution:** DÆDÆLUS
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.21730
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper critiques Lamport's logical clocks, arguing they embed a "forward-in-time-only" assumption that conflates epistemic ordering with an ontic claim of global causal acyclicity. It traces this conflation through impossibility results and modern physics, which only permits local causal structure. The authors propose mutual information conservation as a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency than temporal precedence.

  - **institution:** The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.21844
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes JSAM, a framework that jointly optimizes client selection and privacy compensation in differentially private federated learning to maximize training effectiveness under a budget. It shows that servers should preferentially select privacy-tolerant clients and reveals that clients with minimal privacy sensitivity may incur the highest cumulative costs due to frequent participation. Evaluations demonstrate that JSAM achieves up to 15% higher test accuracy compared to unbiased selection mechanisms.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a novel speculative decoding system that reuses the hidden states from discarded draft tokens to improve computational efficiency. The core method involves performing auto-regressive prediction at the hidden state level and injecting token information later, enabling the construction of high-quality draft token trees from verification failures. The system achieves up to 3.3x speedup compared to standard speculative decoding by transforming wasted computation into reusable tokens.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.21566
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces Minerva, a geo-replicated database system that uses an epoch-based optimistic concurrency control protocol with deterministic re-execution and a conflict graph algorithm to resolve transaction conflicts. It decouples data propagation from commitment to enable high concurrency in multi-leader settings. The evaluation shows it significantly outperforms existing systems in throughput under high latency and scalability.

  - **institution:** The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.21788
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes Dynamic Hybrid Parallelism (DHP), a method that adaptively reconfigures communication groups and parallelism degrees during Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) training to handle heterogeneous data efficiently. It introduces a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with minimal overhead. The results show that DHP significantly outperforms existing frameworks like Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, achieving up to 1.36x speedup in training throughput while maintaining near-linear scaling efficiency.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes LLMTailor, a checkpoint-merging framework that selectively saves only the layers of a large language model that have undergone significant updates, rather than the entire model state. This method significantly reduces checkpoint storage size and I/O time while maintaining model quality, as demonstrated in evaluations with models like Llama3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-7B.
