It achieves O(d) memory and computational complexity per client, making it scalable for high-dimensional models while preserving privacy. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 show it achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across various privacy budgets.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [llm inference], [latency sculpting, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, SLO guarantee, non-intrusive monitoring, distributed inference]
  - **authors:** Du Yin, Jiayi Ren, Xiayu Sun, Tianyao Zhou, Haizhu Zhou, Ruiyan Ma, Danyang Zhang
  - **institution:** Alibaba Cloud Computing, Xi'an Jiaotong University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09258
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper presents LatencyPrism, a zero-intrusion system for online latency monitoring and anomaly detection in LLM inference pipelines. It breaks down inference latency, distinguishes workload-driven variations from anomalies with high accuracy (F1-score 0.98), and guarantees SLO adherence without requiring code changes or service restarts. The system has been successfully deployed at scale across thousands of XPUs, enabling real-time, low-overhead monitoring and proactive alerting.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09374
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper proposes Network-Based Quantum Computation (NBQC), a framework for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing where computational data continuously moves through a network of many small nodes. It shows that NBQC achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and uses nodes more efficiently than measurement-based approaches, providing a foundation for scalable quantum architecture.

  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09393
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces AI-NativeBench, an open-source, white-box benchmark suite for evaluating AI-Native systems by using distributed tracing to analyze agentic spans. The benchmark reveals key engineering insights, such as a "parameter paradox" where smaller models can outperform larger ones in protocol adherence and that inference costs dominate system performance.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper conducts a systematic literature review of 122 research articles to explore the use of serverless computing for high-performance, AI, and big data workloads. It proposes a taxonomy of research directions and use cases, concluding that serverless is a promising model for improving scalability and resource utilization in compute-intensive applications.
