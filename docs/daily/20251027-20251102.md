- **[arXiv251029] Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments**
  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [personalized federated learning, FedAvg, FLIU, client drift, out-of-distribution generalization, heterogeneous data]
  - **authors:** Mortesa Hussaini, Jan Theiß, Anthony Stein
  - **institution:** University of Hohenheim
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24503
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes FLIU, a modified FedAvg approach with adaptive personalization factors, and evaluates both local performance and out-of-distribution generalization in personalized federated learning. The study finds that while personalized methods improve local performance, they inadequately address generalization capabilities compared to traditional federated learning. The research demonstrates the importance of balancing both local optimization and generalization in heterogeneous data environments.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [Differential Privacy, DP-SGD, PDP-SGD, Gradient Leakage Attacks, Federated Learning]
  - **authors:** Miguel Fernandez-de-Retana, Unai Zulaika, Rubén Sánchez-Corcuera, Aitor Almeida
  - **institution:** Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, University of Deusto
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23931
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper evaluates differential privacy mechanisms (DP-SGD and PDP-SGD) as defenses against gradient leakage attacks in federated learning. The results show DP-SGD effectively mitigates reconstruction attacks with moderate utility trade-offs, while PDP-SGD maintains strong model performance but fails as a practical defense. These findings emphasize the need for empirical evaluation of privacy mechanisms beyond theoretical guarantees in distributed learning scenarios.

  - **tags:** [mlsys], [others], [gradient inversion attacks, sparsely-used dictionary learning, federated learning, ReLU activations, linear layers, FedAvg aggregation, DP noise robustness]
  - **authors:** Alexander Bakarsky, Dimitar I. Dimitrov, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev
  - **institution:** ETH Zurich, INSAIT, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24200
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** SPEAR++ improves upon the SPEAR gradient inversion attack by applying sparsely-used dictionary learning techniques to make the attack tractable for larger batch sizes. The new method maintains robustness to differential privacy noise and FedAvg aggregation while scaling to 10x larger batch sizes compared to the original SPEAR attack. This demonstrates practical vulnerability in federated learning systems even with privacy protections in place.
