  - **tags:** [mlsys], [fault-tolerance], [reinforcement learning, adaptive routing, 2D torus, networks-on-chip, packet delivery ratio, fault-adaptive score]
  - **authors:** Mohammad Walid Charrwi, Zaid Hussain
  - **institution:** Kuwait University
  - **link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13096
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based routing strategy for 2D torus Networks-on-Chip, where each router acts as an agent learning to forward packets based on network state. Compared to a traditional adaptive routing baseline, the RL method achieves significantly higher throughput and maintains better packet delivery under increasing node faults by exploiting path diversity. The results demonstrate that RL-driven routing offers superior throughput and fault resilience for torus NoC architectures.
