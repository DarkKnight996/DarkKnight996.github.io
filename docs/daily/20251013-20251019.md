  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes a novel MPI abstraction implemented as an extension of the C++ Noarr library, offering layout-agnostic design for distributed applications. The authors developed a distributed GEMM kernel as a case study to demonstrate the abstraction's usability. Results show the abstraction achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art MPI C++ bindings while providing more flexible application design.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** Justitia introduces a novel scheduler for LLM applications that uses memory-centric service cost modeling, neural network-based demand prediction, and virtual-time fair queuing. It achieves substantial improvements in scheduling efficiency while preserving fairness across diverse LLM applications. The system was implemented atop vLLM and demonstrated enhanced performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.

  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper proposes two FPGA-based solutions for exact k-nearest neighbor search that optimize either throughput or latency while maintaining energy efficiency. The methods use parallel processing approaches for streaming and in-memory datasets. Experimental results show significant improvements over CPU-based competitors, achieving up to 16.6× better throughput/latency and 11.9× energy savings.

  - **link:** http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16946v1
  - **Simple LLM Summary:** This paper introduces an eBPF-based telemetry system for GPU performance diagnosis that correlates host metrics with GPU events. The system achieves 81-88% diagnostic accuracy and identifies root causes like NIC contention and PCIe pressure. It enables debugging in multi-tenant GPU infrastructure without cluster-wide instrumentation.
